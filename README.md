## Project Overview
* This project focuses on classifying near-earth objects (NEOs) as hazardous or non-hazardous based on NASA's NEO dataset. 
* The goal is to implement various machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in predicting potential hazards.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant and redundant columns to ensure high-quality input data.
* Model Implementation: Employed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
* Performance: Achieved up to 96% accuracy in predicting hazardous NEOs.
